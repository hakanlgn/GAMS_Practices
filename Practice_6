* * PRACTICE 6:
* An airline company’s technical service depot worker is responsible for ensuring that they have enough Landing Gear System to meet demand over a period of n days.
* The number dj of Landing Gear System required on the jth day is known in advance.
* To satisfy this requirement, the worker can either buy new Landing Gear System for α each, or he can have Landing Gear System repaired.
* The repair facility provides both fast and slow delivery services.
* In fast service, Landing Gear System are returned q days later for a cost of β per Landing Gear System.
* In slow service, Landing Gear Systems are returned p days later at a cost of γ dollars per Landing Gear System. 
* Naturally, p > q, and α > β > γ.
* Suppose that the worker must plan for a period of n = 10 days, and the number of required Landing Gear System is given as:
* set T /1*10/ ; 
* parameter d(T) / 1 5, 2 6, 3 8, 4 7, 5 5, 6 6, 7 9, 8 8, 9 5, 10 10 / ; 
* Finally, for this problem , we have p = 4; q = 2; α = 20, 000; β = 7, 500; and γ = 2, 500.
* Formulate the worker’s problem as a min cost network flow problem and solve it using GAMS.
