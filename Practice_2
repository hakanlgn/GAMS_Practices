* PRACTICE 2:
* The principal objective in animal feed mixing is to assure that an animal receives all of its formulated nutrient allowances every day.
* Animal feed can be prepared from oats, corn, grass, and peanut hulls.
* Table 2 shows each of ingredients with the percentage of recommended daily allowances for protein, fat, and fiber that a serving of it fulfills.
* The current cost of oat, corn, grass and peanut hulls are $200, $150, $100, and $75, respectively.
* Formulate and solve a linear program to find a minimum cost feed mixture that statisfies at least 60% of the daily allowance for protein and fiber while not exceeding 60% of the fat allowance.
* Table 2:
*                 Oat     Corn     Grass    Peanut Hulls
* Protein (%)     60       80         55           40
* Fat (%)         50       70         40          100
* Fiber (%)       90       30         60           80
