# GAMS Practices

This repository contains a collection of practice problems and solutions implemented in **GAMS**, focusing on core topics in **Operations Research** and **Optimization**.

The models are prepared as part of academic practice and cover various linear programming and network flow applications.

## Contents

Each folder corresponds to an individual practice problem:

### Practice 1 – Basic Linear Programming
- Formulates a basic linear programming model.
- Focuses on production planning with resource constraints.

### Practice 2 – Feed Mixing Problem
- Minimum-cost feed mixing model.
- Satisfies nutritional requirements while limiting fat content.

### Practice 3 – Speaker Pairing Optimization
- Pairing speakers based on frequency response differences.
- Minimizes matching coefficients under quality constraints.

### Practice 4 – Production Planning Under Demand Uncertainty
- Multi-period production planning problem.
- Considers demand uncertainty and adjustment costs.

### Practice 5 – Shortest Path Problem
- Shortest-path formulation using linear programming.
- Determines the minimum-distance route in a road network.

### Practice 6 – Landing Gear Planning
- Minimum-cost network flow model.
- Plans procurement and repair of landing gear systems over time.
- Considers fast and slow repair options with different costs and delays.
