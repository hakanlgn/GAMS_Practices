* PRACTICE 1:
* A furniture manufacturer in Yalova produces four different items: bookcases, desks, chairs, and bedframes.
* For each item required metal, wood and labor are given in Table 1.
* The company has only 225 hours of labor, 117 units of metal, and 420 units of wood available per day.
* Formulate an LP model that determines the production quantities that maximize (daily) net profit.
* Table 1 – Resource requirements per unit (Given in the problem):
*                 Metal(unit)    Wood(unit)     Labor(unit)     Profit ($)
*     Bookcase        1              4              3             19
*     Desk            1              3              2             13
*     Chair           1              3              1             12
*     Bedframe        1              3              2             17

* MODEL 1:
